<p><b>Daniel also commented:</b> <q>The album is good, but not wow, I liked it instrumentally, because 
                                I like such vintage and synths, daring bass, percussion drums and other percussion,     
                                in general this album reminded me of one song "Chaka Khan - Ain't Nobody", 
                                only it was released 1983 and Dua Lipaâ€™s actual style is very similar, but for me the album is one-time, 
                                there are no songs so I listened separately, although I liked a couple of songs...</q></p>
